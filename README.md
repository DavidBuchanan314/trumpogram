The World, according to Donald Trump

## Output
\[TODO ;)\]

## About
There isn't much to this project, just plugging a few existing tools together.

## Corpus
The corpus for this project was obtained from multiple sources (I might add more):

 - 2016 Campaign speeches, from [ryanmcdermott/trump-speeches](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/trump-speeches)
 - @realDonaldTrump's tweets, via [tweet_dumper.py](https://gist.github.com/yanofsky/5436496)
